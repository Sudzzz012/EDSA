  <h1>Service 2 - D4 BELOW 12 MONTHS</h1>
</header>
<div class="container">

  <p><strong>Thank you for signing up with Erase Debt SA.</strong> By accepting the DebiCheck authorization, you have already confirmed your agreement to the service terms and conditions, carefully explained during your signup call. This section gives you a detailed explanation of the process, timelines, and your responsibilities.</p>

  <h2>Important Payment Notes</h2>
  <p>Your DebiCheck debit order may run 1 or 2 days before the scheduled debit date due to weekends, public holidays, or bank processing. We track your payments within 72 to 120 hours (3 to 5 working days) after signup to avoid any delays. Missing a payment or not submitting required documents will delay the process. The full timeline typically takes up to 12 weeks after final payment, depending on creditor responses and NCR updates.</p>

  <h2>Detailed Service Description</h2>
  <p>As a client under D4 status, you already have a court order in place. To exit debt review, you must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pay all outstanding debts in full</li>
    <li>Collect paid-up letters for each account</li>
    <li>Obtain a clearance certificate from a debt counsellor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our team will assist you once we receive all full payments. We will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Review your credit profile</li>
    <li>Help list accounts needing settlement</li>
    <li>Guide you in obtaining paid-up letters</li>
    <li>Submit these to the NCR for final clearance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is important that you continue paying your creditors until everything is settled. We strongly advise you not to apply for new credit or perform credit checks during this process, as it can negatively affect our work.</p>

  <h2>Payment Milestones (Successful Payment Towards Your Services)</h2>
  <p>Every payment milestone is important. Payments need to be successfully tracked and cleared to keep the process moving forward on time.</p>

  <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Make timely payments</li>
    <li>Submit all required paid-up letters and supporting documents</li>
    <li>Stay in communication with our admin team</li>
    <li>Provide honest feedback about staff handling and communication</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Some Clients Finish Faster Than Others</h2>
  <p>Some clients' accounts are simpler, with fewer creditors and no complications. Others have complex, multi-creditor arrangements, which can add time. We treat every client equally, but timelines depend heavily on your individual credit situation.</p>

  <h2>Communication and Updates</h2>
  <p>We provide regular updates every 3 to 5 working days after each payment or milestone. If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach us at: 031 500 2220 or 031 109 5560, or visit <a href="https://www.erasedebtsa.net">www.erasedebtsa.net</a> to submit a query or track progress using your ID number.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="legal">
    <p>You have a 5-business-day cooling-off period after signing up. Cancellation requests after this window will incur a non-refundable admin and application fee. Written notice is required to cancel any debit order - sent to <a href="mailto:queries@erasedebtsa.co.za">queries@erasedebtsa.co.za</a> - at least 10 working days before the debit date. Canceling the debit order does not cancel the service agreement, and any legally owed amounts cannot be reclaimed.</p>
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> The non-refundable admin and application fee is set at <strong>R2300</strong> or equal to the first DebiCheck debit order amount. If the first DebiCheck debit order is less than R2300, a second debit will be processed to cover the full admin and application fee after the 5-business-day cooling-off period.</p>
