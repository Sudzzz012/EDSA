</header>
<div class="container">

  <p>Thank you for signing up with Erase Debt SA. By accepting the DebiCheck authorization, you have already confirmed your agreement to the service terms and conditions, as carefully explained during your signup call. This section explains the negative listing removal process for RN A status clients, from your first successful payment to final resolution.</p>

  <h2>Important Payment Notes</h2>
  <p>Please note that your DebiCheck debit order may process 1 to 2 days before the scheduled debit date due to weekends, public holidays, or bank processing timelines. We track your payments carefully within 72 to 120 hours (3 to 5 working days, excluding weekends and public holidays) after signup to ensure your process moves forward smoothly. Missing a payment or failing to provide required documents can delay the process, which typically takes 8 to 12 weeks after final payment.</p>

  <h2>Detailed Service Description</h2>
  <p>This service focuses on helping RN A status clients by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Requesting a formal transfer from your current debt counsellor</li>
    <li>Conducting an affordability assessment to confirm your financial status</li>
    <li>Investigating and working to remove eligible negative listings, such as prescribed debts, expired enquiries (over 12 months), paid-up admin orders, and paid-up judgments</li>
    <li>Correcting inaccurate or outdated credit information where applicable</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Current arrears, recent judgments, admin orders, or enquiries cannot be removed.</p>

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
  <p>The process typically takes 8 to 12 weeks after full payment, depending on the complexity of your profile and creditor cooperation.</p>

  <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Make full payment before we begin</li>
    <li>Provide any requested documentation promptly</li>
    <li>Avoid contacting your current debt counsellor, as this can disrupt the process</li>
    <li>Provide feedback on our staff performance to help us improve our services</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Timelines Can Differ</h2>
  <p>Every client profile is unique. Some removals are straightforward, while others involve complex verification or creditor communication. We handle each case carefully, but processing time depends on the individual situation.</p>

  <h2>Communication and Updates</h2>
  <p>Our admin team provides regular updates every 3 to 5 working days after key milestones. For any queries, please call 031 500 2220 or 031 109 5560, or visit <a href="https://www.erasedebtsa.net">www.erasedebtsa.net</a> to submit a query or track progress using your ID number.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="legal">
    <p>You have a 5-business-day cooling-off period after signing up. Cancellation requests after this window will incur a non-refundable admin and application fee. To cancel a debit order, written notice must be sent to <a href="mailto:queries@erasedebtsa.co.za">queries@erasedebtsa.co.za</a> at least 10 working days before the debit date. Please note: canceling the debit order does not cancel the service agreement, and any legally owed amounts cannot be reclaimed.</p>
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> The non-refundable admin and application fee is set at <strong>R2300</strong> or equal to the first DebiCheck debit order amount. If the first DebiCheck debit order is less than R2300, a second debit will be processed to cover the full admin and application fee after the 5-business-day cooling-off period.</p>
