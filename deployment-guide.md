# 🚀 WHY YOUR CHANGES AREN'T SHOWING ON GITHUB

## 🤔 **THE ISSUE:**

Your changes are being made **LOCALLY** (in this development environment), but they're **NOT automatically pushing to GitHub**. 

## 📍 **WHERE YOUR FILES ARE RIGHT NOW:**

1. **✅ DEVELOPMENT:** Your files are updated here (what you see)
2. **❌ GITHUB:** Your files are NOT updated there yet
3. **❌ LIVE WEBSITE:** Not updated until you deploy

## 🔄 **HOW TO SYNC TO GITHUB:**

### **MANUAL DEPLOYMENT (Do this now):**

```bash
# Step 1: Build your project
npm run build

# Step 2: Deploy to GitHub
npm run deploy
```

### **AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT (Set up once):**

```bash
# Start webhook server for automatic updates
npm run webhook
```

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Get your GitHub token** from: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. **Add it to your .env file:**
   ```
   GITHUB_REPO=Sudzzz012/EDSA
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
3. **Run deployment:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## 🚀 **AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**

Your changes will appear on:
- ✅ **GitHub repository:** https://github.com/Sudzzz012/EDSA
- ✅ **Live website** (if connected to hosting)
- ✅ **All synced automatically** going forward

## ⚡ **QUICK FIX:**

The deployment scripts are ready - you just need to **run them once** to sync everything!
