  <h1>Service 3 - D4 AITC<br>(4-in-1 Credit Report Only)</h1>
</header>
<div class="container">

  <p>This service provides a detailed 4-in-1 credit report from the four major bureaus (TransUnion, XDS, VeriCred, and Experian) to help you understand your financial standing.</p>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> This service does not include any debt review removal, legal filings, or account removals. It is strictly an advisory service.</p>

  <p>Once we receive your full payment, we will pull the full 4-in-1 report, analyze it, and deliver a written advisory explaining your next steps. This report will disclose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All listings (including good standing and negative)</li>
    <li>Account balances</li>
    <li>Paid-up accounts</li>
    <li>Prescribed accounts</li>
    <li>Paid-up judgments or admin orders</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This information is essential for you to understand where you stand financially and what actions (if any) need to be taken next.</p>

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
  <p>We aim to complete this within 2 to 3 weeks after final payment.</p>

  <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Make full payment before we begin</li>
    <li>Provide any supporting documentation if requested</li>
    <li>Understand that no removal or legal work is included; this is strictly for report delivery and advisory purposes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Feedback</h2>
  <p>We encourage you to provide feedback on how our team handles your request so we can continue to improve our services.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="legal">
    <p>You have a 5-business-day cooling-off period after signing up. Cancellation requests after this window will incur a non-refundable admin and application fee. Written notice is required to cancel any debit order, sent to <a href="mailto:queries@erasedebtsa.co.za">queries@erasedebtsa.co.za</a>, at least 10 working days before the debit date. Canceling the debit order does not cancel the service agreement, and any legally owed amounts cannot be reclaimed.</p>
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> The non-refundable admin and application fee is set at <strong>R2300</strong> or equal to the first DebiCheck debit order amount. If the first DebiCheck debit order is less than R2300 a second debit will be processed to cover the full admin and application fee after the 5-business-day cooling-off period.</p>
