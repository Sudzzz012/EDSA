<div class="container">

  <p>Thank you for signing up with Erase Debt SA. By accepting the DebiCheck authorization, you have confirmed your agreement to our service terms and conditions, as explained during your signup call. This page gives you a full breakdown of what to expect from this service, including timelines, client responsibilities, and admin requirements.</p>

  <h2>Important Payment Notes</h2>
  <p>Your DebiCheck debit order may process 1–2 days before your scheduled date, depending on bank processing times, public holidays, or weekends. We track your payments carefully 3–5 working days after sign-up. Late payments or missing documents may cause delays. Most cases are completed within 6–8 weeks after final payment and document submission.</p>

  <h2>Service Description</h2>
  <p>This service is for clearing negative listings that appear on your credit report. These may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Settled but still listed accounts</li>
    <li>Paid-up judgments</li>
    <li>Admin orders</li>
    <li>Accounts listed in error</li>
    <li>Prescribed or outdated records</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once payment is received, we’ll pull your full 4-in-1 credit report and assist in identifying and clearing the listings that qualify. You may be required to submit paid-up letters or supporting documents. This process may require communication with the credit bureaus or data providers, and timelines may vary.</p>

  <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure full payment is made before processing begins</li>
    <li>Provide paid-up letters and ID copies as needed</li>
    <li>Respond to requests from our admin team promptly</li>
    <li>Avoid making new credit applications until the service is complete</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Timelines Vary</h2>
  <p>Each credit profile is different. Some listings are resolved in days, while others require investigation or dispute procedures. Please be patient and allow the full 6–8 weeks for processing and confirmation from bureaus.</p>

  <h2>Communication and Support</h2>
  <p>You will receive updates every 3–5 working days after each payment or milestone. You can also contact us by phone at 031 500 2220 or 031 109 5560, or visit <a href="https://www.erasedebtsa.net">www.erasedebtsa.net</a> to submit a query or track your status using your ID number.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="legal">
    <p>You have a 5-business-day cooling-off period after signing up. Cancellation requests after this period will incur a non-refundable admin and application fee. If you wish to cancel your debit order, written notice must be sent to <a href="mailto:queries@erasedebtsa.co.za">queries@erasedebtsa.co.za</a> at least 10 working days before the debit date. Canceling the debit order does not cancel the agreement. Any completed admin work remains billable.</p>
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> The non-refundable admin and application fee is <strong>R2300</strong>. If your first DebiCheck debit is less than R2300, a second debit will be processed to cover the full amount after the 5-day cooling-off period.</p>
