<div class="container">

  <p>Thank you for signing up with Erase Debt SA. By accepting the DebiCheck authorization, you have confirmed your agreement to our service terms and conditions, as explained during your signup call. This page provides full information about the RN OTHER/NL removal process and what you can expect.</p>

  <h2>Important Payment Notes</h2>
  <p>Your DebiCheck debit order may process 1–2 days before your scheduled debit date due to weekends, holidays, or banking processes. We confirm payments within 3–5 working days. Late or missed payments can delay the service. Completion typically takes 6–10 weeks depending on your case details.</p>

  <h2>Service Description</h2>
  <p>This service assists clients who:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Were previously under debt review but no longer are</li>
    <li>Were never under debt review but still show blocks or negative listings</li>
    <li>Have judgments, admin orders, expired inquiries, or other outdated negative items</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We pull your full credit report, assess what’s removable, and begin the necessary steps to correct or remove qualifying listings. Listings may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prescribed accounts</li>
    <li>Expired inquiries (older than 12 months)</li>
    <li>Paid-up judgments or admin orders</li>
    <li>Settled but still-listed accounts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pay in full before the process begins</li>
    <li>Provide paid-up letters and copies of your ID as requested</li>
    <li>Avoid taking new credit or credit checks during this time</li>
    <li>Submit documents promptly when contacted by our admin team</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Timelines May Vary</h2>
  <p>Some accounts or listings are resolved quickly, while others require back-and-forth with credit bureaus or supporting creditors. Profiles with many historic issues may take longer. We aim to be transparent and provide accurate updates throughout.</p>

  <h2>Communication and Support</h2>
  <p>Our admin team will provide progress updates every 3–5 working days after payment or milestones. For questions, contact us at 031 500 2220 or 031 109 5560. You may also submit a query or track your case at <a href="https://www.erasedebtsa.net">www.erasedebtsa.net</a> using your ID number.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="legal">
    <p>You have a 5-business-day cooling-off period after signing up. Cancellation after this period will incur a non-refundable admin and application fee. To cancel a debit order, written notice must be sent to <a href="mailto:queries@erasedebtsa.co.za">queries@erasedebtsa.co.za</a> at least 10 working days before your debit date. Canceling a debit order does not cancel your agreement. Work already completed remains billable.</p>
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> The non-refundable admin and application fee is <strong>R2300</strong>. If the first DebiCheck debit is less than this, a second debit will be processed after the cooling-off period to complete payment.</p>
