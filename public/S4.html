<div class="container">

  <p>Thank you for signing up with Erase Debt SA. By accepting the DebiCheck authorization, you have already confirmed your agreement to the service terms and conditions, as carefully explained during your signup call. This section provides you with a full overview of what to expect during the advisory process, from payment milestones to your credit report review and our professional recommendations.</p>

  <h2>Important Payment Notes</h2>
  <p>Please note that your DebiCheck debit order may process 1 to 2 days before the scheduled debit date. This is due to factors like weekends, public holidays, or the way banks process transactions. We track payments carefully within 72 to 120 hours (3 to 5 working days, excluding weekends and public holidays) after signup to ensure we stay on schedule. Missing a payment or delaying document submissions will delay your overall process timeline, which typically takes 2 to 3 weeks after final payment.</p>

  <h2>Detailed Service Description</h2>
  <p>This service focuses on delivering expert guidance and credit-specific advice based on a comprehensive 4-in-1 credit check that we conduct using the four major South African credit bureaus:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TransUnion</li>
    <li>XDS</li>
    <li>VeriCred</li>
    <li>Experian</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once full payment is received, we will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pull your complete 4-in-1 credit report</li>
    <li>Review and identify any negative factors or issues on your profile</li>
    <li>Prepare a detailed written report explaining the negative areas and providing clear, actionable advice on how to improve your creditworthiness</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This service is advisory only. It does not include legal removals, debt review withdrawals, or court filings.</p>

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
  <p>We aim to complete the advisory report and send it to you within 2 to 3 weeks after full payment has been made.</p>

  <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure full payment is made before we begin.</li>
    <li>Provide any supporting documentation we request to assist the process.</li>
    <li>Understand that this service is purely for advice and does not include legal work or removals.</li>
    <li>Provide feedback on how our staff handled your query so we can improve service quality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Timelines Can Differ</h2>
  <p>Some clients' credit profiles are straightforward and quick to assess, while others require more investigation due to complex credit histories or irregularities. We treat every client equally, but timelines depend on the unique details of your profile.</p>

  <h2>Communication and Updates</h2>
  <p>Our admin team provides regular updates every 3 to 5 working days after each payment or milestone is reached. If you need to contact us, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Call 031 500 2220 or 031 109 5560</li>
    <li>Visit <a href="https://www.erasedebtsa.net">www.erasedebtsa.net</a> to submit queries or track your process using your ID number.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="legal">
    <p>You have a 5-business-day cooling-off period after signing up. Cancellation requests after this window will incur a non-refundable admin and application fee. To cancel a debit order, written notice must be sent to <a href="mailto:queries@erasedebtsa.co.za">queries@erasedebtsa.co.za</a> at least 10 working days before the debit date. Please note: canceling the debit order does not cancel the service agreement, and any legally owed amounts cannot be reclaimed.</p>
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> The non-refundable admin and application fee is set at <strong>R2300</strong> or equal to the first DebiCheck debit order amount. If the first DebiCheck debit order is less than R2300, a second debit will be processed to cover the full admin and application fee after the 5-business-day cooling-off period.</p>
