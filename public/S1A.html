<div class="container">

  <p><strong>Thank you for signing up with Erase Debt SA.</strong> By accepting the DebiCheck authorization, you have already confirmed your agreement to the service terms and conditions, which were carefully explained during your signup call. This section gives you a comprehensive breakdown of what you can expect: from your first successful payment, through documentation, processing, legal preparation, and final service delivery.</p>

  <h2>Important Payment Notes</h2>
  <p>Please note your DebiCheck debit order may process 1 or 2 days before the scheduled date. This happens due to weekends, public holidays, or bank processing times. We track your payments carefully within 72 to 120 hours (3 to 5 working days, excluding weekends and public holidays). After signup to keep everything on track. It is crucial to understand that missing a payment or failing to submit required documents can delay the service timeline, which typically takes up to 12 weeks after final payment, depending on court dates and creditor responsiveness.</p> This happens due to weekends, public holidays, or bank processing times.

  <h2>Detailed Service Description</h2>
  <p>If you are still paying the debt counsellor, Erase Debt SA will initiate a formal transfer request within 72 hours of your sign-up. Our admin team will contact you to provide a Power of Attorney (POA) form, which you will need to sign and return along with a copy of your ID. This allows us to proceed with the official handover. The transfer will be handled by our partnered debt counsellor, Debt Mate. We will draft all necessary court documents for you to represent yourself in court, or you may choose to use your own attorney, or our panel of attorneys (at an additional cost).</p>

  <h2>Payment Milestones (Successful Payment Towards Your Services)</h2>
  <p>Each payment milestone is critical to maintaining progress on your case. Every payment made must be tracked successfully; otherwise, your timeline and completion date will shift forward.</p>

  <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure timely payments each month.</li>
    <li>Submit signed POA forms and ID copies when requested.</li>
    <li>Avoid communicating with the prior debt counsellor without our guidance.</li>
    <li>Respond promptly to any additional document or information requests.</li>
    <li>Provide feedback on staff performance to help us maintain service quality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Some Clients Move Faster Than Others</h2>
  <p>Each case is unique; some clients have straightforward credit profiles, while others involve complex legal histories or multiple creditors. We treat all clients equally, but processing times can differ depending on the complexity of your situation.</p>

  <h2>Communication and Updates</h2>
  <p>Our administrative team provides regular updates every 3 to 5 working days after payments or major milestones. You can also contact us directly via our office landline numbers: 031 500 2220 or 031 109 5560, or visit <a href="https://www.erasedebtsa.net">www.erasedebtsa.net</a> to submit queries or track your process using your ID number.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="legal">
    <p></p><p>You have a 5-business-day cooling-off period after signing up. Cancellation requests after this window will incur a non-refundable admin and application fee. To cancel a debit order, written notice must be sent to <a href="mailto:queries@erasedebtsa.co.za">queries@erasedebtsa.co.za</a> at least 10 working days before the debit date. Canceling the debit order does not cancel the service agreement. Any amounts legally owed cannot be reclaimed.</p>
    <p>Please note: The non-refundable admin and application fee is set at R2300 or equal to the first DebiCheck debit order amount. If the first DebiCheck debit order is less than R2300, a second debit will be processed to cover the full admin and application fee after the 5-business-day cooling-off period.</p>
